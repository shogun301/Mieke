# Acute Rehabilitation Plan & Discharge Discussion for Katherine  

## 1. Acute Rehabilitation: Definition & Purpose  
- **What It Is**: Intensive, inpatient rehab designed for patients needing **multidisciplinary therapy (PT, OT, speech therapy)** for at least **three hours per day** (minimum 15 hours/week).  
- **Who Qualifies**: Patients who are **medically stable** but require significant therapy to regain function before transitioning home.  
- **Key Differences from Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)**:  
  - SNF focuses on **custodial care with some therapy** (typically <1 hour/day).  
  - Acute rehab is for patients needing **higher-intensity therapy** and medical oversight.  

## 2. USC Arcadia Acute Rehabilitation Offerings  
- Located at **USC Arcadia Hospital** (formerly Methodist Hospital of Southern California).  
- Provides **specialized neuro-rehabilitation** for patients with cognitive deficits due to conditions like **CNS lymphoma**.  
- Interdisciplinary team includes **physiatrists (rehab doctors), physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and neuropsychologists**.  
- Must meet admission criteria: ability to **participate in at least three hours of therapy per day** and **demonstrate potential for improvement**.  

## 3. Medicare & AARP Medigap Coverage for Acute Rehabilitation  
### **Medicare Part A Covers**:  
- Full cost for **days 1–60** (after Part A deductible).  
- Coinsurance for **days 61–90** ($408/day in 2024).  
- Limited **lifetime reserve days** (after day 90, $816/day).  

### **AARP Medicare Supplement (Medigap) Plans May Cover**:  
- Medicare **Part A deductible** and **coinsurance** (varies by plan).  
- Extended **hospital and rehab stay coverage** beyond Medicare’s limit.  
- **Skilled Nursing Facility coinsurance** if needed later.  

### **What’s NOT Covered**:  
- Long-term custodial care if Katherine cannot participate in rehab.  

## 4. Discussion Strategy with City of Hope Discharge Case Manager  
### **Objective**:  
Advocate for acute rehabilitation instead of skilled nursing, given Katherine’s **cognitive impairment** and **rehab potential**.  

### **Key Talking Points**:  
- **Skilled nursing is not appropriate**: Katherine’s cognitive deficits from **CNS lymphoma** mean she needs **intensive cognitive, physical, and occupational therapy**, not just basic nursing care.  
- **Medicare & Medigap coverage**: She meets criteria for **acute rehab under Medicare**, and AARP Medigap can cover additional costs.  
- **USC Arcadia’s neuro-rehab program**: Specialized for cases like hers, with a proven model for **cognitive rehabilitation**.  
- **Discharge Plan Alignment**: Acute rehab improves outcomes and reduces rehospitalization risk.  

### **Request for Action**:  
- Initiate **acute rehab referral process**.  
- Contact **USC Arcadia’s acute rehab intake team** to assess admission criteria.  
- Expedite insurance pre-approval and discuss transportation logistics.  

## 5. Follow-Up Actions  
- Confirm **referral submission** and request **status updates** from both **City of Hope and USC Arcadia**.  
- Verify **Medicare and AARP Medigap eligibility** with provider.  
- If **denied for acute rehab**, explore appeal options or alternative **high-level rehab programs**.
