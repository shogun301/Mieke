# Antidepressant Options for Depression Related to Brain Tumors

| Antidepressant  | Class | When to Consider | Pros | Cons | Notes |
|------------------|------|------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| **Sertraline** (Zoloft) | SSRI | General first-line, broad use | Well-tolerated, good for mood and anxiety | Can cause GI upset, sexual side effects | Safe with most cancer and seizure meds |
| **Escitalopram** (Lexapro) | SSRI | General first-line, especially if polypharmacy is a concern | Few drug interactions, well-tolerated | Can cause drowsiness, sexual side effects | Simple dosing, clean profile |
| **Citalopram** (Celexa) | SSRI | Older adults, generalized depression | Well-tolerated, good evidence in cancer patients | QT prolongation at higher doses | Not ideal if heart issues present |
| **Mirtazapine** (Remeron) | Tetracyclic | Depression with insomnia, poor appetite, anxiety | Improves sleep and appetite | Can cause sedation and weight gain | Especially useful if on steroids causing insomnia |
| **Bupropion** (Wellbutrin) | NDRI | Frontal lobe involvement, fatigue, apathy | Energizing, no sexual side effects | Increases seizure risk | Avoid if tumor or treatment raises seizure risk |
| **Venlafaxine** (Effexor) | SNRI | Depression with pain (tumor compressing nerves) | Helps with pain and mood | Can raise blood pressure, withdrawal if missed dose | Works well for combined physical and emotional symptoms |
| **Paroxetine** (Paxil) | SSRI | Rarely first choice (consider only if patient has taken it successfully before) | Sedating (can help anxiety/insomnia) | Anticholinergic, cognitive slowing, withdrawal risk | Generally avoided in brain tumor cases |
| **Duloxetine** (Cymbalta) | SNRI | Depression with physical pain, anxiety | Good for mixed physical/emotional symptoms | Can cause nausea, dizziness | Similar to venlafaxine but smoother tapering |
