## **TL;DR – Key Takeaways for Differentiating Delirium, Depression, and Psychosis**

### **Core Differences**  
| Condition   | Time Course | Attention | Consciousness | Hallucinations | Mood | Common in... |
|--------------|-------------|------------|----------------|----------------|-----|---------------|
| **Delirium** | Acute (hours to days), fluctuates | **Impaired** (hallmark) | **Clouded**, fluctuating | Visual/tactile > auditory | Labile | Hospitalized, ICU, elderly |
| **Depression** | Subacute (weeks to months), persistent | Normal (may seem poor from rumination) | Clear | Rare (except in psychotic depression) | Persistently low/sad | Elderly, medically ill |
| **Psychosis** | Subacute to chronic | Normal (unless disorganized) | Clear | **Auditory** > visual | Variable; often flat or inappropriate | Adolescents/young adults, chronic cases |

---

### **Key Clinical Red Flags**
- **Fluctuating alertness or attention = Delirium until proven otherwise.**
- **Fixed false beliefs (delusions) + clear sensorium = Psychosis.**
- **Sustained sadness + loss of interest = Depression.**

---

### **Common Misdiagnoses**
- **Hypoactive delirium** = Often mistaken for depression (quiet, withdrawn patient).
- **Hyperactive delirium** = Can resemble psychosis (agitated, hallucinating).
- **Psychotic depression** = Confused with schizophrenia if mood symptoms are missed.
- **Pre-existing psych disorder patient with acute change** = Always suspect delirium first, not a “relapse.”

---

### **Critical Diagnostic Clues**
- **Acute onset + disorientation + inattention** = Delirium.
- **Persistent mood symptoms without fluctuating sensorium** = Depression.
- **Bizarre or systematized delusions + preserved attention** = Schizophrenia/primary psychosis.

---

### **Useful Tools**
- **Delirium:** CAM (Confusion Assessment Method), 4AT, EEG (generalized slowing in delirium)
- **Depression:** PHQ-9, GDS (for elderly)
- **Psychosis:** No perfect screening tool, but BPRS or PANSS can quantify severity.

---

### **EEG Clue**
- **Delirium = Slowed EEG.**
- **Depression/Psychosis = Normal EEG (unless meds or sleep disorders present).**

---

### **Collateral History is Gold**
- Ask family: "How was this person last week?" Sudden changes = delirium. Gradual decline = depression/dementia.

---

### **Response to Treatment**
- **Delirium:** Improves rapidly if underlying cause is treated.
- **Depression:** Gradual improvement over weeks with antidepressants.
- **Psychosis:** Needs antipsychotics; often chronic.

---

### **Key Message**
- If it’s **acute**, **fluctuating**, and attention is poor: think **delirium**.
- If it’s **persistent low mood** with no clear sensorium changes: think **depression**.
- If it’s **bizarre beliefs/hallucinations** with **clear sensorium**: think **psychosis**.
- In all cases, consider **underlying medical causes first**, especially in hospitalized or elderly patients.

# In Depth: Differentiating Delirium, Depression, and Psychosis

**Introduction:** Delirium, depression, and psychosis are distinct clinical syndromes, but they often present with overlapping symptoms that can complicate diagnosis – especially in hospital or geriatric settings. For example, an elderly patient with hypoactive delirium may appear depressed, while a hyperactive delirious patient might seem psychotic ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20delirium,46%2C23)). Accurate differentiation is critical, as treatment differs markedly for each condition ([

            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Based%20on%20clinical%20experience%2C%20we,delirium%2C%20and%20review%20clinical%20management)). Below we summarize diagnostic criteria (DSM-5 and ICD-10), key distinguishing features, common diagnostic pitfalls, neurocognitive markers, comparative study findings, and assessment tools for each condition.

## Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5/ICD-10)

- **Delirium:** DSM-5 defines delirium as an **acute, fluctuating disturbance in attention and awareness** plus an additional cognitive disturbance (e.g. memory, language, perception) ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=Delirium%20is%20defined%20by%20the,all%20of%20the%20following%20criteria)). Symptoms develop over *hours to days* and tend to fluctuate. The disturbances cannot be explained by another neurocognitive disorder (like dementia) and are not occurring in a state of severely reduced arousal (coma) ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=Delirium%20is%20defined%20by%20the,all%20of%20the%20following%20criteria)). Critically, DSM-5 requires evidence that the disturbance is a **direct physiological consequence of an underlying medical condition, substance intoxication/withdrawal, or toxin** ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=,level%20of%20arousal%20or%20coma)). (ICD-10 similarly requires acute onset and fluctuating course, but DSM-5’s criteria explicitly emphasize identifying an underlying cause ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=,25)) ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=attention%20and%20impaired%20cognition%20,25)).) Other common features of delirium include sleep-wake cycle disturbance, perceptual disturbances (illusions or hallucinations), delusions, and emotional lability ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=,11)).

- **Depression:** In DSM-5, *major depressive disorder* (MDD) is characterized by **at least a 2-week period of depressed mood and/or loss of interest (anhedonia)**, accompanied by ≥4 other symptoms such as changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbance, fatigue, poor concentration, psychomotor agitation/retardation, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide ([Depression - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430847/#:~:text=neurovegetative%20symptoms%20which%20include%20changes,loss%20of%20interest%20or%20pleasure)) ([Depression - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430847/#:~:text=2)). These symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment and not be due to substances or medical illness. The mood in depression is typically persistently *low, sad, or apathetic*, in contrast to the fluctuating consciousness of delirium or the fixed false beliefs of psychosis. (ICD-10 criteria for depressive episode are similar, requiring duration ≥2 weeks and characteristic depressive symptoms.) Depression is a **mood disorder**, so alterations in mood and affect are central, whereas gross disorientation or hallucinations are not typical unless depression is severe with psychotic features.

- **Psychosis (Schizophrenia and related disorders):** *Psychosis* refers to loss of contact with reality, typically manifesting as **delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thinking**. DSM-5 criteria for **schizophrenia** (the prototypical primary psychotic disorder) require **two or more** of the following symptoms for at least one month: **(1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech**, (4) grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, or (5) negative symptoms (diminished emotional expression or avolition). At least one of the symptoms must be 1, 2, or 3 ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=Two%20,3)) ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=4,behavior)). There must also be **functional impairment** (e.g. in work or social life) and continuous signs of disturbance for ≥6 months (including prodromal or residual symptoms) ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=Significant%20functional%20decline%20in%20areas,of%20prominent%20delusions%20or%20hallucinations)). Other psychotic disorders (like *brief psychotic disorder* or *schizoaffective disorder*) have variations in duration or mood components, but **hallucinations or delusions in a clear sensorium** are the hallmark of primary psychotic illness. By contrast, if hallucinations/delusions occur exclusively during a depressive or manic episode, the diagnosis is a mood disorder with psychotic features, not schizophrenia ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=match%20at%20L719%20hallucinations%20or,and%20severity%20of%20mood%20disturbances)) ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=hallucinations%20or%20delusions%20occur%20only,and%20severity%20of%20mood%20disturbances)). (ICD-10 criteria similarly require at least one month of characteristic symptoms; ICD-10 further subtypes schizophrenia into paranoid, catatonic, etc. ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=2.%20ICD,or%20equal%20to%201%20month)) ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=,culturally%20inappropriate%20or%20implausible)).)

## Key Clinical Features for Distinguishing These Conditions

Despite some overlapping symptoms (e.g. cognitive changes can appear in all three), several clinical features help differentiate delirium, depression, and psychosis:

- **Onset and Course:** Delirium has an **acute onset (hours to days)** with **fluctuating course** over the day ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Onset%20Weeks%20to%20months%20Hours,care%20May%20be%20intact%20or)). Symptoms often **worsen at night** (“sundowning”). Depression usually develops over **weeks to months**, with a more **gradual onset** of depressive mood and relatively stable course (episode lasts at least two weeks, often months) ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Onset%20Weeks%20to%20months%20Hours,care%20May%20be%20intact%20or)). Psychotic disorders vary: schizophrenia typically has an insidious onset in late adolescence/early adulthood, but acute psychotic episodes can develop subacutely (days to weeks). Unlike delirium, primary psychosis generally does *not* wax and wane dramatically from hour to hour – the patient’s grip on reality remains continuously impaired until treated. 

- **Level of Consciousness and Attention:** **Delirium** uniquely involves an **altered level of consciousness** and **attention deficits**. Patients are often *drowsy, easily distracted, or hypervigilant* and cannot focus or sustain attention (e.g. cannot follow a conversation or repeat a sequence of numbers) ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=,tends%20to%20fluctuate%20in%20severity)) ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=The%20presence%20of%20delirium%20requires,and%20either%203%20or%204)). In contrast, **depressed** patients are typically *awake and oriented*; their concentration may be reduced by low motivation or ruminations, but gross inattention of the delirium type is not present. **Psychotic** patients (schizophrenia) are usually *alert* and oriented to person, time, and place – their sensorium is clear unless a delirium is superimposed ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20,Despite%20its%20potential)). Any apparent confusion in psychosis is often due to disorganized thinking rather than true clouding of consciousness. (For example, a paranoid psychotic patient might *claim* to be in another location or time due to a delusional belief, but if pressed, they have the capacity to note reality – a phenomenon sometimes called “double-bookkeeping” ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Clinicians%20should%20also%20be%20aware,a%20person%20who%20believes)).) Thus, **fluctuating alertness and impaired attention strongly suggest delirium**, not a primary depression or psychotic disorder.

- **Mood and Affect:** **Depression** is characterized by a pervasive *low or sad mood*, often with anxiety or irritability. Patients may appear tearful, hopeless, or report an inability to feel pleasure. In **delirium**, mood can be rapidly **labile** – one moment agitated or fearful, later apathetic or somnolent – reflecting the fluctuating brain state. A delirious patient might be anxious or combative especially when hallucinating or in unfamiliar surroundings, then later quiet and withdrawn. In **psychosis**, mood is variable: schizophrenia classically features a *disconnect between mood and thought content* (affect may be flat or incongruent). However, psychosis can also occur in mood disorders: e.g. a **psychotic depression** often involves mood-congruent delusions (such as guilt, nihilism, or dire hopelessness in line with the depressed mood) ([Distinguishing the Three Ds (Delirium, Dementia, Depression)](https://www.thecarlatreport.com/blogs/3-carlat-psychiatry-webinars/post/5120-distinguishing-the-three-ds-delirium-dementia-depression#:~:text=Distinguishing%20the%20Three%20Ds%20,delusions%20of%20guilt%20or%20nihilism)). If delusions/hallucinations are mood-congruent and occur only during a depressive episode, psychotic depression is diagnosed rather than schizophrenia. In short: **depression’s mood change is sustained and primary**; in schizophrenia mood changes are secondary or blunted; in delirium mood swings are erratic and secondary to the waxing/waning confusion.

- **Hallucinations and Delusions:** **Psychosis** is marked by prominent hallucinations (most often *auditory voices* in schizophrenia) and delusions (fixed false beliefs). These can also occur in delirium, but there are differences. **Delirium** often causes **visual or tactile hallucinations** (e.g. seeing insects or distorted faces, feeling bugs crawling on skin) and fleeting delusions that are typically **fragmented or paranoid** in content (often about the immediate environment or hospital staff) ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Results%3A)). For example, a delirious patient might believe nurses are trying to harm them, reflecting fear and misinterpretation of the hospital context. In **primary psychotic disorders**, hallucinations are more commonly auditory (hearing voices conversing or commenting) and delusions can be complex and systematized (e.g. elaborate conspiracies, grandiose abilities, bizarre beliefs not tied to the current environment). Also, delirium-induced hallucinations tend to occur on a background of impaired consciousness (the patient is disoriented or inattentive during the hallucination), whereas a schizophrenic patient can often discuss their delusion with intact orientation. **Depression** rarely includes hallucinations/delusions *unless* it is a severe depression with psychotic features. In psychotic depression, any hallucinations/delusions usually reflect the **mood theme** (e.g. hearing voices saying one is worthless, or delusions of guilt, poverty, impending disaster consistent with depression) ([Distinguishing the Three Ds (Delirium, Dementia, Depression)](https://www.thecarlatreport.com/blogs/3-carlat-psychiatry-webinars/post/5120-distinguishing-the-three-ds-delirium-dementia-depression#:~:text=Distinguishing%20the%20Three%20Ds%20,delusions%20of%20guilt%20or%20nihilism)). **Key point:** *The presence of clear consciousness and predominantly auditory hallucinations points to primary psychosis; prominent visual hallucinations or fluctuating delusional confusion suggests delirium; mood-congruent delusions suggest depression with psychosis*.

- **Orientation and Memory:** Patients with **delirium** often have **disorientation to time/place** and significantly **impaired short-term memory** (they may not remember hospital staff or recent events due to inattention) ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=symptoms%20as%20relating%20to%20past,including%20depression%2C%20psychosis%20and%20dementia)) ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=it%20is%20the%20psychiatric%20features,this%20creates%20may%20explain%20the)). In **depression**, orientation is intact and memory may subjectively feel poor but objective memory testing is generally normal (except in so-called “pseudodementia” of depression, where concentration deficits mimic memory loss). Psychotic patients are usually oriented (unless severely disorganized), and memory is variable – chronic schizophrenia can cause some cognitive impairment, but not the acute, global memory failure of delirium. Notably, if a patient seems disoriented, that’s a **red flag for delirium** or an organic brain issue, not typical of uncomplicated depression or primary psychosis ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Disturbance%20in%20awareness%20,many%20acute%20psychiatric%20conditions%20present)) ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC

- **Course with Treatment:** Delirium, being medical in origin, often **resolves rapidly with treatment of the underlying cause** (e.g. correcting infection, electrolytes, etc.), sometimes within hours or days. Depression usually responds over **weeks** to therapy (pharmacological or psychotherapy) – it’s not an immediate recovery. Psychotic disorders may require prolonged antipsychotic treatment and often follow a chronic course with residual symptoms. So the time frame of symptom evolution and resolution provides clues: *a dramatic overnight improvement strongly suggests delirium (once cause treated), whereas depression or schizophrenia would not clear up so quickly* ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Onset%20Weeks%20to%20months%20Hours,care%20May%20be%20intact%20or)) ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Course%20Chronic%3B%20responds%20to%20treatment,intact%20or%20impaired%20May%20be)).

## Common Misdiagnoses and Diagnostic Challenges

Because of overlapping features, misdiagnosis is unfortunately common. Some typical pitfalls and challenges include:

- **Hypoactive Delirium mistaken for Depression:** In *hypoactive* delirium, patients are quiet, withdrawn, and may appear sad or fatigued – leading staff to think they are “depressed” when in fact they are acutely confused ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20delirium,46%2C23)) ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=Hypoactive%20delirium%20subtype%2C%20being%20an,may%20not%20be%20a%20true)). This is a frequent cause of missed delirium. Studies indicate hypoactive delirium is underdiagnosed because these patients don’t cause disruptions; their reduced alertness and slow responses are “misconstrued as symptoms of depression” ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=of%20delirium,dementia%20are%20highly%20prevalent%20in)). **Older patients** are especially at risk of this confusion, as they often develop hypoactive delirium and also have higher prevalence of true depression ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=be%20a%20non,patients%20in%20previous%20studies%3B%20repeated)). Clinicians must maintain suspicion for delirium in any acute hospital patient who “just seems very down or out of it” suddenly.

- **Hyperactive Delirium mistaken for Psychosis or Mania:** Conversely, a delirious patient who is agitated, hallucinating, and talking incoherently can resemble a primary psychotic or manic episode. Terms like “ICU psychosis” historically described delirious patients in intensive care ([ICU Psychosis: The Danger is Real - CEUfast](https://ceufast.com/course/icu-psychosis-the-danger-is-real#:~:text=ICU%20Psychosis%3A%20The%20Danger%20is,The)). The key is the **acute onset and fluctuation** – a schizophrenic psychosis doesn’t suddenly come and go or improve with treating a medical condition. Nevertheless, delirium with prominent hallucinations/delusions can be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric illness initially. **Ganser syndrome (dissociative disorder)** and **delirious mania (mania with delirium)** are examples of rare conditions that mimic delirium’s confusion or combine with it ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Based%20on%20clinical%20experience%2C%20we,delirium%2C%20and%20review%20clinical%20management)) ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=delirium,occur)), further confusing the picture. Careful neurological exam and workup for medical causes is essential whenever a “first-episode psychosis” presents atypically (e.g. older age, acute onset, fluctuating course).

- **Depression with Psychotic Features vs. Schizophrenia:** Differentiating a severe depression with psychosis from schizophrenia can be challenging, since both may have delusions or hallucinations. The context and course are critical: if psychotic symptoms occur *only during depressive episodes*, it’s likely psychotic depression. In practice, psychotic depression is often **underdiagnosed**, with patients sometimes misclassified as having schizophrenia or treated for depression alone ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=serious%20illness%20during%20which%20a,19%20and%20undertreated3%20psychiatric%20disorder)) ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=psychotic%20depression%20since%202000%2C1%20,discussed%20above)). One reason is that patients with psychotic depression often focus on depressive complaints, and clinicians might not probe for subtle delusions. Conversely, a patient with schizophrenia might report feeling “down” when in fact this is secondary to negative symptoms or social consequences of psychosis, not a primary major depression. Studies have found that **psychotic depression is distinct**: for example, it tends to have more severe neuroendocrine disturbances (high cortisol levels, etc.) than non-psychotic depression, and differs from schizophrenia in certain biological markers ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=psychotic%20symptoms%20that%20occur%20in,night%20sleep%20electroencephalogram%20readings.%2018)) ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC

Recognizing mood symptoms in a psychotic patient (or psychotic symptoms in a depressed patient) is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis. 

- **“Diagnostic Overshadowing” by Psychiatric History:** Patients with an existing psychiatric history (e.g. known schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) who develop delirium may have their new symptoms erroneously attributed to their mental illness. Clinicians may prematurely label an acute change as “just their schizophrenia acting up,” a cognitive bias known as **diagnostic overshadowing** ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=The%20strong%20association%20between%20the,psychiatric%20conditions%20such%20as%20depression)). Research shows that medically ill patients with psychiatric comorbidities have higher rates of delirium misdiagnosis ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=highlights%20the%20issue%20of%20%E2%80%98diagnostic,The%20cognitive%20aspects%20of)). One study found **two-thirds of delirious patients with a past psychiatric illness were misdiagnosed** at referral ([

Thus, **having a mental illness does not preclude delirium** – new onset confusion in such a patient should not be automatically written off as “psychosis.” Careful assessment for delirium (attention, acute medical issues) is needed even in psychiatric patients ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=who%20were%20referred%20to%20CLP,mood%2C%20affect%2C%20thought%20form%2C%20thought)) ([

- **Depression vs. Dementia vs. Delirium:** (Although the question focuses on psychosis rather than dementia, it’s worth noting another challenge.) In older adults, depression-related cognitive impairment (sometimes called *pseudodementia*) can mimic dementia, and an underlying dementia can predispose to delirium. This “3 D’s” overlap makes diagnosis tricky. For instance, an elderly person with baseline memory issues who becomes acutely worse could have superimposed delirium or depression. Careful history of the time course (acute change suggests delirium) and mood symptoms (depression often coexists) is important ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Onset%20Weeks%20to%20months%20Hours,early%2C%20impaired%20as%20disease%20progresses)) ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Self,before%20ADLs%20as%20disease%20progresses)). Often, multiple conditions coexist (e.g. a patient with dementia can also develop delirium and become depressed about their illness). This requires a nuanced approach, sometimes treating depression and delirium concurrently and reassessing cognition after resolution.

- **Under-recognition of Psychosis in Depression:** As mentioned, psychotic depression is often missed. A telling statistic: even though guidelines recommend combined antidepressant-antipsychotic therapy for depression with psychotic features, one study found **only ~5% of such patients actually received appropriate combination treatment**, implying that many cases are not identified or adequately managed ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20despite,psychosis%20in%20these%20patients%2019)) ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=antidepressant%20and%20an%20antipsychotic,discussed%20above)). Clinicians may focus on mood symptoms and not ask about hallucinations or delusional thoughts in depressed patients, so screening for psychosis in any severe depression is a must. Conversely, some patients with chronic schizophrenia can also develop depression (post-psychotic depression), and distinguishing that from negative symptoms of schizophrenia is an ongoing clinical challenge.

In summary, *delirium is frequently misdiagnosed as depression or dementia, especially if hypoactive ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=hypoactive%2C%20hyper,46%2C23)), and conversely delirium with agitation can be misdiagnosed as a primary psychosis. Depression with psychosis can be mistaken for schizophrenia, and prior psychiatric history can mislead clinicians when new symptoms arise.* Awareness of these pitfalls and maintaining a broad differential are essential for accurate diagnosis.

## Neurobiological and Cognitive Markers

Beyond clinical observation, certain investigations and markers can aid differentiation:

- **Electroencephalography (EEG):** EEG is often **abnormal in delirium**, showing generalized slowing of background activity (increased theta and delta waves) reflecting diffuse cerebral dysfunction ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20,Despite%20its%20potential)). In contrast, **primary psychiatric illnesses (depression or schizophrenia)** usually have a **normal EEG** (aside from possible medication effects or sleep-related changes) ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20,Despite%20its%20potential)). Thus, if uncertainty remains, an EEG can be helpful: *marked diffuse slowing strongly favors delirium over functional psychosis*. (One exception is delirium tremens, which can show fast activity from alcohol withdrawal, but the clinical context differs.) Some debate the utility of routine EEG, since slowing is nonspecific, but it can confirm an encephalopathic process ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20,Despite%20its%20potential)). Recent studies affirm that EEG slowing correlates with delirium severity and outcomes ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar)). In primary **depression**, EEG is not used for diagnosis, though sleep EEG in depression often shows reduced REM latency or other sleep architecture changes, and **psychotic depression** specifically has been associated with distinct all-night EEG patterns compared to schizophrenia ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=psychotic%20symptoms%20that%20occur%20in,night%20sleep%20electroencephalogram%20readings.%2018)) ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC

- **Cognitive Testing:** Bedside cognitive tests can uncover delirium. **Inattention** is the hallmark – e.g., inability to recite the months backward or repeat a sequence of digits is common in delirium but not in pure depression or chronic psychosis. A simple test like the **“World” spelled backward** or days of week backward can differentiate: delirious patients will often struggle significantly or give incoherent answers, whereas depressed patients might perform slowly but correctly (if they put in effort), and schizophrenic patients can usually do it unless actively distracted by hallucinations or thought disorganization. **Orientation questions** (date, place, situation) are usually answered correctly by depressed or psychotic patients (unless the psychosis is extreme), but delirious patients often miss these. That said, severe psychosis can *simulate* cognitive failure if the patient is too paranoid or internally preoccupied to engage in testing ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=orientation%2C%20language%2C%20visuospatial%20ability%2C%20or,patient%20from%20engaging%20in%20assessment)) ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=several%20domains%3A%20memory%2C%20orientation%2C%20language%2C,or%20evaluate%20for%20these%20findings)). For instance, a schizophrenic patient might *refuse* to answer orientation questions (thinking the interviewer is plotting something), whereas a delirious patient *attempts* but answers incorrectly. Additionally, the **fluctuation** in performance is key: a delirious patient’s cognitive test results may vary hour to hour, whereas true psychiatric conditions show more consistency. 

- **Neurobiological Markers:** Currently, there are no definitive blood tests to distinguish these conditions in real time, but some correlations exist. **Delirium** is often associated with an acute medical illness – so lab findings might show an infection (leukocytosis), metabolic disturbances (e.g. high urea, low sodium), or toxic substances, which are clues pointing to delirium rather than a primary psychiatric disorder. In terms of neurotransmitters, delirium is thought to involve widespread dysregulation (e.g. cholinergic deficiency and dopamine excess in the brain), whereas **schizophrenia** is linked to chronic dopamine D2 hyperactivity (especially in mesolimbic pathways) and **depression** involves chronic deficiencies or dysregulation in serotonin/norepinephrine systems. These are theoretical frameworks; practically, measuring neurotransmitters isn’t useful for diagnosis. **Inflammatory markers** (like CRP, IL-6) are often elevated in delirium (due to underlying illness) and have been studied as contributors to delirium pathogenesis, whereas in depression or schizophrenia any inflammation tends to be subtler or chronic.

- **HPA Axis and Other Biomarkers:** Interesting differences have been noted between psychotic depression and schizophrenia: for example, patients with **psychotic depression** tend to have **higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity** (e.g. elevated cortisol, more frequent failure of dexamethasone suppression) compared to those with schizophrenia ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=increased%20risk%20of%20psychotic%20depression,night%20sleep%20electroencephalogram)) ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=psychotic%20symptoms%20that%20occur%20in,night%20sleep%20electroencephalogram%20readings.%2018)). Sleep studies also show that psychotically depressed patients often have more pronounced REM sleep abnormalities than schizophrenic patients ([
            Challenges in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686458/#:~:text=increased%20risk%20of%20psychotic%20depression,night%20sleep%20electroencephalogram%20readings.%2018)). These findings suggest biological distinctions: a patient with prominent melancholic features, early-morning awakening, and high cortisol might be more likely suffering from depression with psychosis rather than a primary schizophreniform illness. While such tests are not routine in acute diagnosis, they are *research markers* that support the clinical differentiation.

- **Imaging:** Neuroimaging is generally more useful to *rule out* structural causes (e.g. stroke, tumor causing delirium or mood/behavior changes) than to confirm these diagnoses. A head CT/MRI is usually normal in primary depression or schizophrenia (aside from nonspecific changes or ventricular enlargement in some schizophrenia cases). In delirium, imaging could show an acute issue (e.g. encephalitis, stroke) if that’s the cause. Functional imaging (PET/SPECT) can show globally reduced cortical metabolism in delirium, whereas schizophrenia might show specific hypofrontality, and depression certain patterns of hypoactivity in frontal lobes or anterior cingulate – but these are not used clinically for differentiation.

In summary, **EEG** is the most cited ancillary test to distinguish delirium (showing slowing) from a primary psychiatric disorder (usually normal EEG) ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20,Despite%20its%20potential)). **Cognitive tests of attention and orientation** are simple but powerful at the bedside. Ongoing research into biomarkers (electrophysiological, endocrine, inflammatory) continues, but clinical acumen remains paramount in distinguishing these conditions.

## Comparative Studies in Clinical Settings

Multiple clinical studies and reviews in recent years have focused on the differentiation of delirium, depression, and psychosis, particularly in hospital environments where diagnostic accuracy is vital:

- **Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) Studies:** A large retrospective study (2016–2018) in a hospital **psychogeriatric consultation service** compared delirium cases to other psychiatric diagnoses ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=The%20objectives%20of%20the%20present,psychiatrists%20from%20the%20CLP%20unit)) ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=2)). Of 1,017 elderly inpatients referred to psychiatry, **43.8% were diagnosed with delirium** after psychiatric evaluation ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=Delirium%20N%20%3D%20445%20%2843.76,0.000%20%28w%29%20Gender)) ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=222%20%2849.89,NS%20%28f)). Strikingly, many of these delirious patients had been mislabeled by the referring medical teams: among those ultimately diagnosed with delirium, **only 60%** had delirium suspected on referral, while **22.7% were initially referred as “depression”** and others as anxiety or adjustment problems ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=Psychiatric%20Diagnosis%20Referring%20Service%20Anxiety,0.001%20%28f)). This underscores how commonly delirium presents atypically (especially the hypoactive subtype) and is mistaken for depression or other issues. The same study found that referrals from surgical and ICU wards had higher rates of delirium misdiagnosis than referrals from general medicine, likely because surgical/ICU staff encountered delirium frequently and sometimes normalized it or missed subtle cases ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=)) ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=It%20is%20also%20important%20to,insomnia%20and%20the)). Psychiatric consultation significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, but overall concordance between the initial referring diagnosis and the psychiatrist’s delirium diagnosis was only ~30–40% ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC

- **Misdiagnosis Rates:** A 2020 study using machine-learning on CLP data reported delirium misdiagnosis rates around 50% on average, with literature ranges from ~42% to 64% in most studies ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=Rates%20of%20delirium%20misdiagnosis%20range,13)). One study cited in that review found a misdiagnosis rate as high as 73% when strict criteria were used ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=%5B11%20%5D%20to%2064,13)). Factors associated with **higher misdiagnosis** included *psychiatric comorbidity* and *hypoactive presentation*, as discussed, as well as patient age (some studies found more errors in very old or very young patients) ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=The%20strong%20association%20between%20the,psychiatric%20conditions%20such%20as%20depression)) ([

These studies highlight the need for better training of hospital staff to suspect delirium and not default to a psychiatric label without considering acute medical causes ([

- **“Pseudodelirium” Conditions:** A 2021 review by Oldham et al. (J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci) specifically examined **psychiatric syndromes that mimic delirium**, termed *pseudodelirium* ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Objective%3A)) ([

Four difficult differentials were discussed: **disorganized psychosis**, **Ganser syndrome (factitious “twilight” state)**, **delirious mania**, and **catatonia**. The review provided clinical vignettes and noted how each can resemble delirium and how to differentiate them. For instance, **disorganized schizophrenia** can produce incoherence and odd behavior resembling the confusion of delirium, but in psychosis the sensorium is clear and EEG normal ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Based%20on%20clinical%20experience%2C%20we,delirium%2C%20and%20review%20clinical%20management)) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Results%3A)). **Delirious mania** presents with mania, psychosis, and clouded consciousness combined – a true overlap syndrome requiring both medical and psychiatric intervention ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=delirium,occur)). **Catatonia**, with its hypoactive and hyperactive forms, can also be mistaken for delirium (and indeed can co-occur with delirium), but catatonic patients often have normal orientation and an exquisite response to benzodiazepines, which is not a treatment for delirium ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=delirium,occur)) ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=EEG%20is%20typically%20normal%20in,may%20not%20always%20be%20feasible)). This review emphasizes that thorough evaluation (including neurological exam, mental status exam, collateral history, and sometimes empiric trials like a lorazepam challenge for catatonia) is required to parse out these cases ([
            Pseudodelirium: Psychiatric conditions to consider on the differential for delirium - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A)). The concept of *pseudodelirium* reminds clinicians to consider unusual psychiatric conditions once medical delirium has been reasonably ruled out.

- **Depression vs. Dementia vs. Delirium in Elderly:** Although the focus here is on psychosis rather than dementia, it’s worth noting foundational studies in geriatric psychiatry on the “3 D’s.” An older but classic reference is a 2008 AMA article summarizing differences in **depression, delirium, and dementia** ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Table%201,be%20unaware%20of%20cognitive%20deficits)) ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Onset%20Weeks%20to%20months%20Hours,early%2C%20impaired%20as%20disease%20progresses)). It provided a comparative table: delirium had acute onset and fluctuating course, dementia chronic progressive onset, and depression subacute but potentially reversible. It also noted that depressed elders are often very aware and worried about their memory problems (complaining of forgetfulness), whereas those with true dementia are often unaware or in denial of their deficits ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=Course%20Chronic%3B%20responds%20to%20treatment,intact%20or%20impaired%20May%20be)). While not directly about psychosis, this kind of comparative work has informed clinicians how to systematically approach an elderly patient with confusion or cognitive complaints – first ask: is it acute (think delirium), chronic (dementia), or related to mood (depression/pseudodementia)? Modern studies continue in this vein, sometimes adding biomarkers or imaging, but the core clinical distinctions remain relevant.

- **Psychotic Depression vs. Schizophrenia:** Some research has specifically compared symptomatology and outcomes in psychotic mood disorders versus primary psychotic disorders. For example, Parker et al. (2019) examined differences between **psychotic depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar psychosis**, finding that the manifestations of psychosis differ more in degree than kind – however, psychotic depression patients had more insight and predominant mood symptoms, while schizophrenia patients had more bizarre delusions and negative symptoms ([Comparisons With Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in the ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3686464/#:~:text=,and%20occur%20within%20a)). Also, longitudinally, psychotic depression tends to have a better functional outcome if treated (because the psychosis resolves with the depression), whereas schizophrenia is more chronic. These findings reinforce the importance of identifying a mood disorder if present, as it guides prognosis and treatment.

- **ICU and Medical Settings:** In ICU patients, the term “ICU psychosis” is essentially delirium. Studies in critical care find delirium prevalence is high (50–80% in ventilated ICU patients) ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045404/#:~:text=Delirium%20is%20a%20common%20neuropsychiatric,25)), and it’s associated with worse outcomes. Depression and PTSD-like syndromes can emerge or persist after ICU delirium ([Depression Persistent After ICU Delirium - Discoveries in Medicine](https://discoveries.vanderbilthealth.com/2022/09/unrelenting-depression-after-icu-delirium/#:~:text=Depression%20Persistent%20After%20ICU%20Delirium,For%2015%20years)). While not a direct differentiation study, one 2021 analysis found that patients who experienced delirium in the ICU were more likely to report depression and cognitive deficits in the months after discharge ([Depression Persistent After ICU Delirium - Discoveries in Medicine](https://discoveries.vanderbilthealth.com/2022/09/unrelenting-depression-after-icu-delirium/#:~:text=Depression%20Persistent%20After%20ICU%20Delirium,For%2015%20years)), indicating how delirium and subsequent depression might be linked rather than confused. Still, in the acute ICU setting, one must distinguish delirium from **sedative effects or anxiety**; standardized delirium screening like CAM-ICU is commonly used ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=4,hypervigilance%2C%20drowsiness%2C%20or%20stupor)). Psychosis per se is less common in ICU unless due to delirium or substance withdrawal.

In summary, **recent studies consistently show that delirium is under-recognized and often misdiagnosed as depression or other psychiatric problems in hospital settings ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20delirium,46%2C23)) ([
            Delirium misdiagnosis risk in psychiatry: a machine learning-logistic regression predictive algorithm - PMC

Comparative research on psychotic depression vs schizophrenia, and on pseudodelirium conditions, provide deeper insight into subtle differences, but in practice the primary differentiators remain the time course, sensorium, and context of symptoms.

## Assessment Tools and Scales for Differentiation

Clinicians employ several **standardized tools** to help identify and differentiate delirium, depression, and psychosis. While diagnosis ultimately relies on clinical judgment using DSM/ICD criteria, these instruments improve detection and reduce diagnostic errors:

- **Confusion Assessment Method (CAM):** The CAM is a widely used, validated screening tool specifically for **delirium**. It operationalizes key DSM criteria into an easy bedside algorithm. **CAM requires the presence of:** (1) **acute onset and fluctuating course**, **and** (2) **inattention**, **and** either (3) disorganized thinking or (4) altered level of consciousness ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=The%20presence%20of%20delirium%20requires,and%20either%203%20or%204)) ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=1,status%20with%20a%20fluctuating%20course)). A patient who screens positive on CAM is very likely delirious (sensitivity 94–100%, specificity ~90%) ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=with%20comments%20such%20as%20,it%20includes%20the%20following%20criteria)). The CAM can be done quickly by non-psychiatric staff and is commonly used in hospitals and nursing homes. There are adaptations like **CAM-ICU** for ventilated ICU patients that rely on nonverbal responses (e.g. picking yes/no cards) ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=4,hypervigilance%2C%20drowsiness%2C%20or%20stupor)). CAM helps distinguish delirium from “just baseline dementia or depression” by focusing on acute change and inattention.

- **4AT:** The **4AT** is another rapid delirium screening tool used especially in the UK/Europe. It has four items: Alertness, AMT4 (4-item age/orientation test), Attention (months backward), and Acute change or fluctuating course ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=laboratory%20results%20and%20measurement%20tools%2C,designed%20to%20allow%20accurate%20delirium)). A score ≥4 suggests possible delirium ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=method%20,for%20delirium%20that%20is%20robust)). Like CAM, 4AT is designed to be simple and not require special training.

- **Delirium Rating Scales:** For more detailed assessment (often by psychiatrists), there are instruments like the **Delirium Rating Scale (DRS)** and the **Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS)** which quantify delirium severity. These are useful to track improvement but also have cutoff scores to help distinguish delirium from other conditions. Additionally, tools like the **Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro)** and the **Stanford Proxy Test for Delirium (S-PTD)** have been developed ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=attention%20and%20acute%20change%20or,17%20%2C%2042%2C19%20%2C%2044)) ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=Provisional%20%28DDT,17%20%2C%2042%2C19%20%2C%2044)). The S-PTD, for example, allows nurses to report on a patient’s behavior to detect delirium even if the patient cannot participate in testing ([
            A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141533/#:~:text=Provisional%20%28DDT,17%20%2C%2042%2C19%20%2C%2044)). Such scales are less for differentiating *between* depression/psychosis and delirium and more for confirming delirium and tracking it.

- **Depression Screening Scales:** To identify depression, especially in medically ill or elderly patients, common tools include the **Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)**, which is a brief self-report of the 9 DSM-5 symptoms of depression. Scores provide severity and a cutoff suggests major depression. Another is the **Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)**, a short questionnaire (15 or 30 items) tailored for older adults (it de-emphasizes somatic symptoms that might be due to illness) ([Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06#:~:text=View%20Article%20PubMed%20Google%20Scholar)). In the context of delirium differentiation, if a patient scores high on a depression scale but the history is acute and fluctuating, one should still suspect delirium. Conversely, a low score on depression scales might prompt looking for delirium or dementia instead of assuming depression. **Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI)** and the clinician-administered **Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)** are also widely used to assess depressive symptom severity ([Depression - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430847/#:~:text=1,medical%20history%2C%20and%20current%20medications)). These scales help ensure that a patient’s “flat affect” or apathy is truly due to depression and not just delirium or negative symptoms of psychosis. For example, an older patient in the hospital with low GDS score but cognitive fluctuations is likely delirious rather than depressed.

- **Psychosis Assessment:** There is no equivalent “screening tool” for psychosis as binary as CAM for delirium or PHQ-9 for depression, since psychosis is often obvious when present (hallucinations, delusions). However, standardized interviews like the **Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)** or **Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)** are used in research and practice to rate the severity of psychotic symptoms. These can document the presence of hallucinations, delusions, disorganization, etc. If a patient scores high on these but also has waxing/waning attention, the evaluator is alerted that it might be delirium superimposed. In primary care or general hospital settings, **screening questions for psychosis** (like “Do you hear or see things others don’t?” or “Do you have beliefs that others find strange?”) can be incorporated into assessment. The American Psychiatric Association’s practice guidelines recommend ruling out delirium whenever new psychotic symptoms appear acutely ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=and%20sleep%20issues,dementia%2C%20and%20Lewy%20body%20disease)) ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=brain%20lesions%2C%20heavy%20metal%20toxicity%2C,dementia%2C%20and%20Lewy%20body%20disease)).

- **Cognitive Testing Tools:** Tests like the **Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)** or **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)** can assess a patient’s overall cognitive status. While these are more for dementia screening, certain items (attention, recall) are very sensitive to delirium. A delirious patient’s MMSE score will typically be acutely low (especially on attention/orientation items), whereas a depressed patient might only have mild score reduction (or may give poor effort). A high MMSE (near normal cognition) in a patient who seems “off” behaviorally suggests a primary psychiatric disorder (depression/psychosis) rather than delirium. Repeating a cognitive test at a different time of day is also informative: delirium scores often fluctuate significantly.

- **Collateral History and Functional Assessment:** While not a formal “scale,” obtaining history from family or caregivers about the **baseline mental status** and the **time course of changes** is arguably the most important “tool” in differentiation ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=The%20CAM%20has%20been%20adapted,Other%20important)) ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=for%20the%20emergency%20department%20and,such%20as%20cough%2C%20fever%2C%20headache)). For example, the **Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline (IQCODE)** is sometimes used to assess pre-hospital cognitive function, which can help distinguish delirium superimposed on dementia. Similarly, an informant might fill out a **Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)** to detail behavioral symptoms. These can reveal whether low mood and withdrawal were chronic (supporting depression/dementia) or acutely new (supporting delirium).

- **Physical and Neurological Exam:** Again, not a specific scale, but a thorough exam (including neurological exam) is essential. Focal neurologic signs, autonomic instability, or fluctuating level of arousal point to delirium or an underlying medical issue. In psychosis or depression, the neurological exam is usually normal. Some protocols include delirium screening as a “vital sign” in hospitalized elders, just as one would check for stroke signs.

In practice, clinicians often use **a combination** of these tools. For instance, in an older hospitalized patient, nurses might do a CAM every shift to catch delirium. Meanwhile, the physician might use a PHQ-9 or GDS to screen for underlying depression, and do an MMSE or MoCA to assess cognition. If CAM is positive and PHQ-9 is low, delirium is the focus. If CAM is negative but the patient has cognitive complaints, perhaps depression or a primary psychiatric issue is at play. By systematically using such tools, the differentiation of these conditions is sharpened and the likelihood of misdiagnosis is reduced ([

**Conclusion:** In summary, differentiating delirium, depression, and psychosis requires careful evaluation of the **timeline (acute vs chronic)**, **level of consciousness and attention**, **mood symptoms**, and **presence and type of psychotic features**. Modern diagnostic criteria (DSM-5/ICD-10) provide specific definitions for each condition ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=Delirium%20is%20defined%20by%20the,all%20of%20the%20following%20criteria)) ([Depression - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430847/#:~:text=neurovegetative%20symptoms%20which%20include%20changes,loss%20of%20interest%20or%20pleasure)) ([Schizophrenia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539864/#:~:text=Two%20,3)), and a number of studies emphasize key distinguishing signs (e.g. delirium’s inattention ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=The%20presence%20of%20delirium%20requires,and%20either%203%20or%204)), depression’s persistent sadness ([Depression - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430847/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20mood%20disorder,classifies%20the%20depressive%20disorders%20into)), psychosis’s hallucinations with clear sensorium ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929410/#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20,Despite%20its%20potential))). Misdiagnosis remains a concern, particularly with hypoactive delirium and overlapping syndromes, but awareness and use of standardized assessment tools (CAM, etc.) can greatly improve accuracy ([Delirium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470399/#:~:text=with%20comments%20such%20as%20,it%20includes%20the%20following%20criteria)) ([

In ambiguous cases, collaboration across disciplines – medicine, psychiatry, neurology – is invaluable. Ultimately, appropriate treatment and improved outcomes depend on recognizing these conditions for what they are, as illustrated by the growing body of clinical research over the past several years.
